## About Me 👨‍💻

Hello <span class="wave">👋</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, a tech enthusiast dedicated to sharing and documenting the knowledge I've accumulated, with a recent foray into blogging.

My fascination lies in the potential of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its transformative impact across various domains. I'm particularly interested in exploring the development and implications of AGIs.

I aspire to see functional programming paradigms gaining traction and becoming mainstream, driven by their elegance and efficiency.

I'm deeply enthusiastic about cutting-edge technologies such as WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebXR, and WebTransport, envisioning a future where the web experience transcends current boundaries and offers immersive, seamless interactions.

My curiosity extends to exploring the potential of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and microkernels, while eagerly anticipating the evolution of RISC-V architecture, which holds promise for open, customizable computing.

Embracing Extended Reality (XR) as the future, I'm excited to navigate the ever-evolving landscape and contribute to its advancement.
