## About Me 👨‍💻

Hello <span class="wave">👋</span>  
I'm `Rituraj`, a passionate technology enthusiast eager to share and document the knowledge I've accumulated. Recently delving into blogging, I aim to distill complex concepts into simple, modular, and reusable code.

Fascinated by vision of AGIs and their potential, to revolutionize various fields, I'm keen on exploring their development and implications.

Would like to see functional paradigm becoming mainstream.

Enthusiastic about the transformative potential of technologies like WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebXR, and WebTransport, envisioning a future where the web experience transcends current boundaries.

Keen to explore the realms of GPGPUs and microkernels, while eagerly anticipating the evolution of RISC-V architecture. Embracing XR as the inevitable future, I'm poised to navigate the exciting journey ahead.
