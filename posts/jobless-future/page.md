Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently made a controversial statement at the World Government Summit in Dubai, suggesting that the need for individuals to learn how to code is diminishing due to advancements in artificial intelligence. Huang argued that with AI taking over programming tasks, **it's no longer necessary for young people to learn computer science or programming.** Instead, he believes that the focus should shift towards developing expertise in fields like biology, education, manufacturing, and farming. Huang's perspective is that AI will make everyone a programmer, as it will replace the need for traditional programming languages with human language prompts, making coding accessible to everyone.

Coming from a reputable figure is enough to justify such a statement?

### Present Scenario

Currently, **trained models are marketed as AI**, though the original intent of AI was to augment or replace human intelligence more effectively. If that becomes a reality someday, then the statement about coding's demise gains weight, especially for those whose livelihoods depend on coding.

### A Historical Perspective

The discourse on technological unemployment isn't new.

In 1930, British economist John Maynard Keynes warned of technological unemployment with [his writing](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf). His insights highlighted concerns about labor-saving advances outpacing the creation of new jobs.

Karl T. Compton, the president of MIT from 1930 to 1948, contributed significantly to the discussion on the impact of technology on employment, particularly in his 1938 article titled ["The Bogey of Technological Unemployment."](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MIT-Technology-Review-1938-12.pdf) Compton questioned whether machines would serve humanity or become destructive forces, framing the debate over jobs and technological progress.

Over time, we've witnessed the gradual replacement of human physical labor, particularly tasks not requiring constant decision-making, with machinery. This transition has led to higher precision and effectiveness at reduced costs.

Compton's perspective remains relevant today, especially in the context of contemporary fears surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation, as it emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader economic impacts of technological change.

### Vision: A Jobless Future

Imagine a future where:
- Jobs don't define one's status.
- People aren't forced to work for survival.
- Soldiers have choices beyond just "Do or Die."
- Life is primarily about living to the fullest.

However, we are still far from this vision. Until then, we'll likely adapt to changes as they come.

Some argue that AI will merely assist humans and enhance productivity, but this perspective overlooks the potential of true artificial intelligence, which might operate independently of human intervention.

### Should We Still Learn to Code?

The answer is yes. Even if coding ceases to be a profession in the future, preserving the ability to code remains crucial.

Many subjects in our academic curriculum aren't directly tied to specific professions, yet we still deem them essential. Coding, which has shaped our digital future, should be no exception.
