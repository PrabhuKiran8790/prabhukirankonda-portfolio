## "Coding, A Dying Profession"

- Says CEO of Nvidia.
- While considering his expertise is important, it's not enough to justify such a statement outright.
- Currently, **Trained models are marketed as AI**, though the original intent of AI was to augment or replace human intelligence more effectively. 
- If that becomes a reality someday, then the statement about coding's demise gains weight, especially for those whose livelihoods depend on coding.

### A Historical Perspective

- The discourse on technological unemployment isn't new.
- Back in 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes warned of technological unemployment.
- He observed that labor-saving advances were outstripping our ability to find new uses for labor, leading to widespread concern about job displacement. 
- Karl T. Compton, a prominent scientist of that era, contributed to this discussion, questioning whether machines would serve humanity or become destructive forces.
- Compton's essay from 1938 framed the debate over jobs and technological progress, a debate that resonates today in light of advancements in AI, robotics, and automation. 
- The fear of technology replacing human workers persists, with some envisioning a future where AI dominates every aspect of work.

### Vision: A Jobless Future

- Even today, there are discussions about the possibility of a jobless future.
- Imagine a world
  - where people aren't constrained by the need to work for survival
  - where jobs don't define one's status
  - where life is primarily about living to the fullest.
- However, we are still far from this vision. Until then, we'll likely adapt to changes as they come. 
- Some argue that AI will merely assist humans and enhance productivity, but this perspective overlooks the potential of true artificial intelligence, which might operate independently of human intervention.

### Should we still learn to code ?

- The answer is yes,
- Even if coding ceases to be a profession in the future, preserving the ability to code remains crucial.
- Many skills in our academic curriculum aren't directly tied to specific professions, yet we still deem them essential. 
- Coding, which has shaped our digital future, should be no exception. 
- As we navigate an uncertain future, the ability to code ensures that we remain adaptable and empowered in the face of technological advancements.
