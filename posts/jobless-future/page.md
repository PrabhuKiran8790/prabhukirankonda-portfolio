## Coding, A Dying Profession

Conveyed by the CEO of Nvidia. While considering his expertise is important, it's not enough to justify such a statement. Right ? 

Currently, **trained models are marketed as AI**, though the original intent of AI was to augment or replace human intelligence more effectively. If that becomes a reality someday, then the statement about coding's demise gains weight, especially for those whose livelihoods depend on coding.

### A Historical Perspective

The discourse on technological unemployment isn't new.

Back in 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes warned of technological unemployment. He observed that labor-saving advances were outstripping our ability to find new uses for labor, leading to widespread concern about job displacement.

Karl T. Compton, a prominent scientist of that era, contributed to this discussion, questioning whether machines would serve humanity or become destructive forces. Compton's essay from 1938 framed the debate over jobs and technological progress, a debate that resonates today in light of advancements in AI, robotics, and automation. 
 
The fear of technology replacing human workers persists, with some envisioning a future where AI dominates every aspect of work.

### Vision: A Jobless Future

Imagine a world where people aren't constrained by the need to work for survival, where jobs don't define one's status, where life is primarily about living to the fullest.

However, we are still far from this vision. Until then, we'll likely adapt to changes as they come.

Some argue that AI will merely assist humans and enhance productivity, but this perspective overlooks the potential of true artificial intelligence, which might operate independently of human intervention.

### Should We Still Learn to Code?

The answer is yes, Even if coding ceases to be a profession in the future, preserving the ability to code remains crucial.

Many subjects in our academic curriculum aren't directly tied to specific professions, yet we still deem them essential. Coding, which has shaped our digital future, should be no exception.
